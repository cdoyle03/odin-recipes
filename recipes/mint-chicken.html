    <p1>The dish is a pleasant experience, with a fresh and delightful taste.</p1>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake
            off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until
            browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is
            cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
    </ol>
